### Task List for the First Robust Version of the Plugin Module

This list prioritizes essential functionality and robustness for an initial version, leaving more advanced features and development tools for future iterations.

#### **1. WASM Compilation Environment (Critical)**

*   **Task:** Ensure that the Helix development environment can compile Rust plugins for the `wasm32-wasi` target.
    *   **Details:** This involves installing the `wasm32-wasi` Rust toolchain (`rustup target add wasm32-wasi`) and verifying that the Helix build process can compile the WASM test plugin.
    *   **Justification:** Currently, this is a blocker for testing and validating the WASM part of the implementation. Without this, the WASM functionality is theoretical.

#### **2. Robust Bidirectional Communication (Return Values)**

*   **Task:** Implement a robust mechanism for host functions (Helix) to return values to plugins (WASM and Lua).
    *   **Details (WASM):**
        *   Define a serialization/deserialization protocol (e.g., JSON or bincode) for complex data (strings, structs, etc.) in the shared memory between the host and the WASM plugin.
        *   Implement functions in the `WasmHost` to read data returned by the WASM plugin.
        *   Modify `HelixApi::get_buffer_content` to actually fetch and return the buffer content to the WASM plugin.
    *   **Details (Lua):**
        *   Ensure that `LuaHost` can receive return values from Lua functions called by the host.
        *   Modify `HelixApi::get_buffer_content` to actually fetch and return the buffer content to the Lua plugin.
    *   **Justification:** Essential for any meaningful interaction where the plugin needs data from the editor or needs to return results of its operations.

#### **3. Essential API Expansion (Read and Write)**

*   **Task:** Expand the `HelixApi` to expose the most basic and crucial editor functionalities that plugins will need to be useful.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Read:** Methods to get information about the current editor state (e.g., `get_current_buffer_id()`, `get_selection_ranges(doc_id)`).
        *   **Write/Modification:** Methods to perform basic editing operations (e.g., `insert_text(doc_id, position, text)`, `delete_text(doc_id, range)`, `set_selection(doc_id, selection)`).
        *   **Basic UI:** Methods to display simple prompts or interact with existing pickers (if applicable and safe).
    *   **Justification:** Without a rich enough API, plugins will have very limited functionality.

#### **4. Dynamic Command Management (Completion)**

*   **Task:** Finalize the implementation of dynamic command registration and execution.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Ensure that the `PluginManager` can manage multiple plugins registering commands with the same name (e.g., using namespaces or priorities).
        *   Implement the ability for plugins to unregister commands (if necessary).
        *   Refine the passing of arguments to plugin commands, ensuring that arguments passed by the user in the command line are correctly parsed and delivered to the plugin.
    *   **Justification:** Allows plugins to extend the editor's command set flexibly.

#### **5. Basic Event System (Subscription/Dispatch)**

*   **Task:** Implement a mechanism for plugins to subscribe to and react to specific editor events.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Define an initial set of editor events (e.g., `on_buffer_save`, `on_buffer_open`, `on_mode_change`).
        *   Implement the logic in the `PluginManager` and the hosts (WASM/Lua) to dispatch these events to the plugins that have subscribed to them.
    *   **Justification:** Many plugins need to react to changes in the editor's state to function (e.g., an auto-formatting plugin on save, a linter plugin on buffer change).

#### **6. Error Handling and Reporting (Robustness)**

*   **Task:** Improve error handling and user feedback for plugin failures.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Capture and report plugin execution errors (WASM traps, Lua errors) in a way that does not crash the editor but informs the user.
        *   Provide clear and useful error messages about plugin loading or execution failures.
    *   **Justification:** Essential for robustness and user experience, preventing misbehaving plugins from causing editor instability.
